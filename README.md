This assignment, made me learn that you can have Flex container inside of an NON-Flex container. 
I learned that you can have Flex- Display property assigned to the BODY of the page and have items at content of the page.
How to get hints on alignment of content?
you can imagine the direction of content and see how things can be placed bases on their direction. 
Look into the default direction of the properties.
Know that default wise, flexbox go into ROW direction and make appropriate judgment if you need to manual change the direction of flexbox
